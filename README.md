At [r/roguelikedev](https://www.reddit.com/r/roguelikedev/) we're doing a dev-along following [The Complete Roguelike Tutorial](http://www.roguebasin.com/index.php?title=Complete_Roguelike_Tutorial,_using_python%2Blibtcod).

Rather than use Python and Libtcod, I've decided to use [Go](https://golang.org/) and [BearLibTerminal](http://foo.wyrd.name/en:bearlibterminal). I will also be updating a series of blog posts on my website [jeremyceri.se](http://jeremyceri.se) as each week progresses. I am using this project as an excuse to learn Go, and Bearlibterminal.

I am blogging about the whole experience over at [jeremyceri.se](https://jeremyceri.se), if you're interested in following along.

## Build Instructions

To build this project, first make sure you have Go installed and configured. The BearLibTerminal Go package needs to be present on your GOPATH.

From the command line, navigate to the root of this project, and excecute `go build bearrogue.go`
